**March 13th 2023**

**Agenda**
- We tried training a classifier and then applied it to the merged rep seqs, but it did not work.

- When I ran the code for merging the two taxonomy files, I got this error below.

- Will be moving forward using ONLY the Colombia dataset


**Minutes**
- New metadata files have been made by Aiden with hba1c, glucose and both columns
- Will put this into qiime2 pipeline
- Add in PICRUSt for functional analysis
- Another option would we do a scale of severity for diabetes instead of yes or no diabetic 
  - e.g. higher abundance of certain taxa with increasing fasting glucose or hba1c
- Start with yes/no data and see if we have a correlation
- discussion would be interesting for pre-diabetes as the microbiome can affect health way before diabetes is developed
  
**Action Items**
- finishing our downstream analyses by next Wednesday just using the Colombia dataset
- Starts on results sooner rather than later
- Regenerating all of the data using just the Colombia dataset
- Regenerate the alpha-beta graphs in R studio 
- Short presentation for next week March 27th
    - research question 
    - results and interpretation
    - make headings of results the conclusion
