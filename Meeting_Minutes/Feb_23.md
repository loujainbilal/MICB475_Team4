# **Meeting #4**

## **Agenda** 
- Ask Simran if we should do our entire analysis using both the datasets from the start or do the analysis with one set (ex. Colombia), generate a model and apply it to the second set (ex. Texas)
- New data set from Texas found no significant associations with any of their clinical measures with any particular taxa? is this an issue for our study?
