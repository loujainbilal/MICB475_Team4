# **Meeting #4**

## **Agenda** 
- AIMS! Should we re-structure our aims because during our last meeting we established 6 aims which were general steps?
- Should we do our entire analysis using both the datasets from the start or do the analysis with one set (ex. Colombia), generate a model and apply it to the second set (ex. Texas)?
- New data set from Texas found no significant associations with any of their clinical measures with any particular taxa? is this an issue for our study?
- Ask Simran to look over "Data Wrangling" section outline to confirm contents.
   - F/U: were your suggestions in your email reffering to the metadata data? Or the seq data? (we haven't yet looked into the seq data in great detail). 
   - F/U: We were going to only look at HBA1C or fasting glucose, not both, as many sources have noted that only looking at one is sufficient. We went with HBA1C as there is more literature. Does this work?
- Colombia has manifest.txt file but Texas does not -> implications for importing step
