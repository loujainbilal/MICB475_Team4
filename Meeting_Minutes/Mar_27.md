**Minutes**
- run the significance on R again
- draw the ellipses on graphs for Beta analysis
- highlight the taxa that are unique in each definition
- HBA1C- differentially abundant- are they the same in fasting glucose, and in the core microbiome
- Taxa: see what matches the core microbiome in fasting glucose
- specific species--> functional analysis aligns with the taxa
- compare to the literature

- Add alpha beta as a figure: there isn't a community diversity 
  
- Validate the model: on a new data set
- ask team 11 to send the code to validate: for loop
- Do we see this taxa in a cohort that has prediabetes

FIGURES 
- Figure 1- Two alphas (Shannon and Faith's PD), two betas (bray and one of the unifracs) (two panels, one for alpha, one for beta)
- Figure 2- Core microbiome (without the "both" category)
- Figure 3- Volcano plots  
- Table 1 (indicator taxa)
  - one table for hba1c and one for fasting glucose 
- Table 2 (taxanomic model)
  - ones that are similar between figures 1-3
- Figure 4 (potential) Model Validation: relative abundance plots
  - with the Texas dataset 
- Figure 5 PICRUST
