**Minutes**
- run the significance on R again
- draw the ellipses on graphs for Beta analysis
- highlight the taxa that are unique in each definition
- HBA1C- differentially abundant- are they the same in fasting glucose, and in the core microbiome
- Taxa: see what matches the core microbiome in fasting glucose
- specific species--> functional analysis aligns with the taxa
- compare to the literature

- Add alpha beta as a figure: there isn't a community diversity 
  
- Validate the model: on a new data set
- ask team 11 to send the code to validate: for loop
- Do we see this taxa in a cohort that has prediabetes
